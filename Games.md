## So you want to run games better?

This can be a slightly complicated upgrade, so bear with me here.

Some important things to consider are: How recent is your motherboard and CPU? If they're relatively recent, you shouldn't have to worry about replacing them at all. However, if you do have an older CPU you might consider upgrading both your CPU and possibly your motherboard. The thing here is you want to prevent "bottlenecking" which is what happens when your CPU is too weak to process all the data. Typically this isn't a big issue unless you're running a machine that's running seven plus years. In the event you're curious if you're currently bottle-necking your machine check out this calculator: https://pc-builds.com/calculator/ There you can get an idea if you need to upgrade your CPU or not.

But much more often than not, you want to focus on upgrading your GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). The question to ask yourself here, is how intense do you want your gaming experience to be? Do you want the top of the line graphics, 4K, 60FPS, Ultra-high shadows and ray tracing? If so, consider building a dedicated machine for it instead of simply adding a new graphics card.

But if you want to go with some relatively modest HD gaming with 30FPS, that's not too hard. All you have to do in that case, upgrade your GPU to some equivalent of an NVIDIA GTX 1660. How exactly do you determine what GPU is best for you though? It may seem intimidating at first but it's really not that hard.

## Brand
There are two major brands to consider for graphics cards, AMD and NVIDIA. When it comes to choosing which brand to go with, it doesn't matter all that much. Much more important is the cost factor, so choose whichever brand you like better!

## Numbers are important
The most relevant numbers to look for when you're examining GPU specs is memory type. GDDR5 > GDDR4. And then CUDA cores, these cores basically determine how good a GPU is at rendering images. A GTX 1660 has 1,408 cores. Whereas a GTX 3090 has 10,496
