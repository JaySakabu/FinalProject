### Preface
For this tutorial I'll be covering how to upgrade your computer. You may want to upgrade for a myriad of reasons. I'll also address which components you want to upgrade in the event you don't want to overhaul the majority of your mahine. Why would you want to upgrade your computer? You may be editing on Adobe Premiere and finding that it crashes frequently, or maybe it takes far too long to render a 3 minute clip, what should you do about that? Are you playing a video game at lowest graphic settings and having difficulties playing still? Maybe you don't have enough storage, whatever the case, I'll do my best to address the most broad concerns.
