## This is pretty straightforward

Bottom line _you need more storage_.

But as was discussed a bit on the "Too slow" section, SSDs are better in general. If you need a lot of storage though for a decent price, HDDs aren't a bad idea for a secondary storage. For example, you might want to use both an SSD and a HDD for things like video storage. Videos can take up a lot of storage, and if you get a HDD with a large capacity, those don't cost too much compared to SSDs. 

The question here to consider is how much are you willing to spend for storage? There aren't really any bad options when considering a secondary storage device. But some element to consider when you're looking at two devices with a similar capacity is read/write speeds. The better those speeds are, the better the device is overall.
