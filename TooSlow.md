## There are a lot of reasons why computers are slow

That's the most important take-away from this. But there are tons of ways you can upgrade and increase speed. 

The main ways is making sure you're using SSD storage, for personal computers SSD is typically the best storage to use in terms of read/write speeds. SSDs are non-volatile storage and generally are much faster compared to traditional hard drives. Switching from hard drives to SSDs generally makes things like booting up your computer faster.

Another issue could be RAM, if you only have 4 GBs at DDR3, it may be time to upgrade to some faster and larger ram. 16 GBs suits most needs, and if you get them at speeds of the relatively new DDR5 you could see speed increases.
